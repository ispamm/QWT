### Abstract

Neural network generalizability is becoming a broad research field due to the increasing availability of datasets from different sources and for various tasks. This issue is even wider when processing medical data that may have large variations as being provided by different imaging centers or acquired with diverse devices and cofactors. 
To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel generalizable framework that exploits the potentials of quaternion wavelet transform (QWT) to build a data- and task-agnostic approach that extracts salient features from medical images. The framework can be easily integrated in any pre-existing medical image analysis or synthesis task, and it can be involved with real, quaternion or hypercomplex-valued models, further generalizing their adoption. The proposed method first extracts different sub-bands through QWT, resulting in both low-frequency/approximation bands and high-frequency/fine-grained features. Then, by means of a novel mixture-of-experts approach, it selects the most representative set of sub-bands to be involved as input to the neural model. On a thorough experimental evaluation comprising different grayscale and RGB image datasets, diverse tasks including reconstruction, segmentation and modality translation, and real and quaternion-valued models, we prove the effectiveness and the generalizability of the proposed framework that improves networks performance while being flexible to be adopted in manifold scenarios.
